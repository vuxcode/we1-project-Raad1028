  - Made the sidebar into an iframe in order to easier control it when I start adding more pages to the website. It also made it easier to control the main element because of no longer needing a margin the size of the sidebar.
  - I also had to make the javascript in the iframe able to interact with the javascript of the main website, which turned out to be a bit complicated, but with a bit of googling I managed to find a solution.
  - Changed most of the elements into flex elements as I found them much easier to work with and control.
